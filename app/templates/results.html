            <p>How to Start a Self-Care Routine
                To get started with a self-care routine, the experts we spoke with suggest:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine which activities bring you joy, replenish your energy, and restore your balance.</li>
                    <li>Start small by choosing one behavior you'd like to incorporate into your routine in the next week.</li>
                    <li>Build up to practicing that behavior every day for one week.</li>
                    <li>Reflect on how you feel.</li>
                    <li>Add in additional practices when ready.</li>
                    <li>Get support through sharing practices from loved ones, a coach, a licensed professional (like a therapist or dietitian), or through your healthcare plan, community, or workplace.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Practicing self-care doesn't need to be a heavy lift right out of the gate. Here are a few ideas to ease you into your self-care journey:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Journal.</li>
                    <li>Start each day by paying attention to your breath for five minutes and setting intentions for the day.</li>
                    <li>Eat breakfast.</li>
                    <li>Reflect on what you're grateful for each night.</li>
                    <li>Put your phone on airplane mode for a half hour each night and release yourself from the flurry of notifications.</li>
                    <li>Call a friend just to say hello.</li>
                    <li>Take up a relaxing hobby.</li>
                    <li>Pick a bedtime and stick to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                A review published in 2018 in the journal Health & Place analyzed data from existing studies and found that spending time outdoors can immediately lower stress levels, and that outdoor walks in green spaces are particularly effective.</p>
